# Project 3 Lost In a Forest 

## LOST in the forest

### What It needs to communicate:
* gradual -> darkness, fog and size (smaller)
* anxious
* objects breathing

### Main Idea
I was thinking to have a singular particle you can move around. There will be squiggly trees spawing in with the darkness increasing as you try to click and connect dots togethe. 
What it will have:
* darkness
* green, black and white
* fog (grey)

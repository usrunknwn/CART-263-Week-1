# Project 3 Lost In a Forest 

## LOST in the forest

README files are written in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to format them. Your readme file should contain all the information about your project, and if needed, how to run it. If you need or use libraries or dependencies, list them here and link to where the user can find the appropriate information. 

## What It needs to communicate:
* connection 
* emptyness
* loss of spark (darkness)
* increase of stress (items)

## Main Idea
I was thinking to have a singular particle you can move around. There will be squiggly trees spawing in with the darkness increasing as you try to click and connect dots togethe.

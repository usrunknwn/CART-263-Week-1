# P5 Project 2 - Data Visualization

The CSV file grabbed data from a study of recreational drugs. The study looked into the:

- Physical Harm
- Dependence
- Social Harm
  Of each substance. The grade was from 0-3 (3 being the worst). I would like to make light of the facts about some recreational drugs wheather they are legal or not. Just to show people the truth. There are lots of assumptions and the two most used on here have some of the worst effects.

I didn't think too much about the artistic stide of things so I coded a visual graph of the table. After consideration/feedback from the class I got rid of the values and circles. Not only did it clutter the graph, made things look too academic and people would know that bigger peaks are bad. Overall I would like to add a hovering function so when you hover over the objects it says what category it is, which will make things a lot cleaner. Fix up the text and add a background. 

The code is simple, telling it to draw the data in circles.

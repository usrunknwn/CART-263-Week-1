I didn't think too much about the artistic stide of things so I coded a visual graph of the table. After consideration/feedback from the class I got rid of the values and circles. Not only did it clutter the graph, made things look too academic and people would know that bigger peaks are bad. Overall I would like to add a hovering function so when you hover over the objects it says what category it is, which will make things a lot cleaner. Fix up the text and add a background. 

The code is simple, telling it to draw the data in circles.
